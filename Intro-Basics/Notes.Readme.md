## Chapter 1 : Welcome to Design Patterns 

 -  So, the advantage of using inheritance is that, it makes code duplication easy. Like feature passing, suppose if you          have a super class of “Chair” and you add extra durability support, then al the other Chairs will have the same extra          durability, that’s nice, but at the same time, if you add the ‘color’  property to ‘red’, all the other chair classes          that are sub-classes to this would also be ‘red’ in color. 

 - Interface do include the 'strict' behaviour in the code base, but one downside of it is that, there is no scope for code-reuse inside of an interface.

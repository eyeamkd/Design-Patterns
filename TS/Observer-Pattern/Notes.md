# OBSERVER PATTERN 

## Observer Pattern in one line : 
When MKBHD publishes a video, all his subscribers get notified, here all his subscribers are observers and MKBHD is a Subject. (okay, maybe 2 lines) 

### Loose Coupling 
Two entities in a software must always be loosely coupled, that implies they must be having very little knowledge about each other, and one object's behaviour shouldn't impact the other object that much.
